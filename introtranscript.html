            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Hey everyone. Welcome to The Possible Now, a podcast interview series with the people
              and businesses who are working towards a better future for us all. My name is Jared Henriques and I'm your
              host this season. I'm the founder of Renga, a brand strategy and design studio in Toronto. Our goal at
              Renga has been to help our clients become brands that matter.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">In order to do this effectively, we felt it was
              important to better understand what sustainability looks like in practice across different industries. The
              Possible Now is a front row seat to a series of conversations with business leaders who are solving real
              world problems with sustainable practices. We're excited to share our research with you in this way, a
              better future is possible, and it will take all of us as business leaders, consumers, and citizens to
              start working towards it.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">Now, my guest today is Renga's very own Matthew Im. Matt is the VP of Growth and Brand
              Director here at Renga, but he's also the producer for The Possible Now podcast. In today's episode,
              we're going to be talking about why we decided to focus on sustainability, how this affected him
              personally, and some of the things that we both learned throughout this process.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">Welcome Matt.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Hey Jared. Thanks for having me.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Of course. We definitely wanted to start this conversation off by giving a bit of
              context as to why we decided at Renga to really focus on sustainability, and what sustainability
              meant to us before this podcast, and what it means now just as we're about to move into
              launch.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">So do you mind maybe speaking
              about how you thought about sustainability a few months ago before we started this journey?</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Sure.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">I think everyone is on their own path with sustainability, whether it's positive
              or negative, or whether they're even aware of some of the choicesand decisions they make. But for myself,
              it definitely started more in nutrition and food. Figuring what it was that I was putting into my body,
              and how that what would affec my mental health, my physical health. I started doing more research and
              what I think I found is that
              everything is connected. It's not just about food and nutrition. As we dive deeper into these episodes and
              learning more about the Sustainable Development Goals, realizing that every decision we make has some sort
              of impact or implication. Positive or negative. At Renga, it wasn't just myself having these thoughts. I
              think collectively as a team, even yourself, we were thinking about sustainability and how
              that played out in our
              own lives. Naturally that just became more of a topic of discussion in our business, and our business
              practices, and how we wanted to create impact. Our decision makin with businesses has a cause and
              effect.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s"> So for us, our internal philosophy then became building brands and manner.
              Now matter is obviously a very subjective term, but for us, it was businesses that
              had these values and this mindset of creating a circular
              economy. Business that cared about the planet, people and profits. Naturally just led to creating this
              podcast because we were talking to so many business leaders, CEOs, and founders, we wanted to share that
              knowledge with people who are curious.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">For sure. I think it's been quite fascinating over
              the last few months as we've been recording and editing these episodes.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">Even just observing, I know the change
              that this has had on our organization. As we've decided to go internally through the B Corporation
              process, and really familiarizing ourselves with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
              and how we might apply those to different things, I think it's really compelling. When you talk
              about sustainability and how
              for you, it really manifested in food. I think a lot of people, myself included, growing up in elementary
              school and going through that process, we hear sustainability and we immediately think of the environment.
              We think about planting trees, and the pollution, and some of those different areas. What was one of the
              biggest changes in your perspective throughout this process of sustainability? What was that big aha
              moment, or at least an interesting realization that you might've had throughout this process?</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">I think you
              touched on it. It was the environment. Growing up, I was the same. Recycling, climate change, global
              warming, that is what I associated with the word sustainability. I think the biggest thing that I learned
              is that sustainability isn't just the environment. It's people, communities, how money is spent, business
              practices, inclusion, accessibility. There are so many levels to sustainability and that was the biggest
              eye opening thing for me. It's a lot bigger of an issue than just climate change.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Yeah for
              sure. I think that's a shared sentiment within the Renga team. When we look at people, planet, and profit,
              I think for me, one of the biggest realizations was that profit component.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">Right especially being in some form
              of consultation relationship with a lot of our clients, to be able to speak to them that like, Yes, how
              important it is to move about processes, and supply chains, and everything ethically,
              there is still a level of, you need to ensure that your business can actually sustain and grow itself to
              amplify that impact.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">Sometimes, in an incident like COVID-19 where the whole world has just dramatically
              changed. I think you're seeing a lot of nonprofits really go outof business, and it breaks my heart
              because I think the issue is there's a not necessarily a sustainability to the business model on its own
              without donors. As people get much more tight fisted, they're starting to see their impact to be entirely
              diminished. I think what was really eye opening to me was for that sustainability to be just ingrained
              into the core of a brand's culture, that impact can be just accelerated and amplified globally as we try
              and build out a real healthy business.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Yeah. I think one of the harder things to understand, but also very
              simple is that sustainability is collaboration, not competition. In the business world, they very much
              preach competition. Competition breeds better economic growth. With sustainability, you realize you have
              some sort of power. The longterm end goal is a sustainable world involves partnership. If you are a for
              profit business, partnering with a nonprofit, you both use your skillsets to achieve some sort of goal.
              And money inherently is not evil. It's how you use those funds to give back to communities, to the people,
              to the planet. It's what you're doing with that money what that says about you.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">One of the biggest realizations
              for me was looking at price and understanding that if something is too good to be true, someone somewhere,
              or something is being exploited. Whether it's the planet for its resources, or people for their services
              overseas in third world countries, we just need to do better collectively at understanding that these
              things are happening. Becoming more transparent as consumers and citizens, we have a part to play as well,
              the onus isn't just solely on businesses.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">For sure. I think to that point, throughout this process
              you've also been in the process of launching a side project, which is a clothing company.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">I'd love to know
              how your perspective has changed within that business, as you're starting to think through supply chain,
              and that whole pricing model structure ,and how that all works. How has this podcast and these
              conversations really impacted that thought process?</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Yeah. I would say that it mostly impacted it on a profit sense,
              which is what we actually do with the money that we do make. In terms of building the brand and how we
              wanted to create a supply chain and manufacturing, we always wanted to be local. We always wanted to
              support local businesses and the local economy. Making sure we're working with people that are paying
              their employees a livable wage. What I failed to consider in the beginning was, once you start making
              money, what do you do with that money? That kind of shifted our mentality into
              actually partnering with local charities or organizations that are looking to solve one of many of these
              Sustainable Development Goals. We have the power to do it, and we also care about these things. That's
              something that we've been trying to implement.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Very cool.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">So the last question I had for you
              today, we'll just keep this first episode nice and short, is the name of The Possible Now. What does that
              mean to you? Do you mind just speaking to that a little bit?</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Yeah. It's funny because what I hope to
              happen is impossible. Reaching full sustainability as a race and as a planet is pretty much impossible.
              The act of doing, being more self aware, and learning and educating, as we've seen this entire year,
              change
              is eminent. And so The Possible Now name is just a reflection of the attitude that, Hey, we can actually
              make
              a difference and it starts right now. That could be using a reusable water bottle, a reusable bag, trying
              to waste less, buy less plastic. We're not asking people to be perfect beings. It's just try to make today
              a little better than yesterday. Just continuing moving forward. That's what The Possible Now means to me
              at least.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Yeah, that's great.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">I think it reminds me of a quote. "but the most dangerous
              information is the information that we choose, which not to know." Right. I think what you just
              mentioned in
              terms of reusing, reusable bags and reasonable bottles, and to actually ask questions and maybe look
              into the supply chain of your favorite brands, we all know what might be under there, but we choose not
              to know it.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">And I think The Possible Now is about saying, right now I'm going to choose to do
              what I can, and that
              there is an element to this future that is possible too. Work towards now. And I think that's great.
              From my
              perspective, we're excited to share all of these conversations with everybody who's deciding to listen.
              I know that it's dramatically changed us as an organization at Renga, and us as individuals. Really
              causing us to think a lot more about how we conduct our business, our day to day lives, and what
              it might mean to be a
              healthy business. I thank you for your production work and all the prep that you've done.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">Is there
              anything
              else that you wanted to kind of leave people with before we dive into those interviews?</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">I would say to
              be excited to learn something new. Be excited to be reminded of something you already know. Be excited
              to know that you have the power to make change, whether it's small or big. It's not such a daunting
              ride.
              Sustainability, when given a chance and understood, almost brings a sense of happiness to what you do.
              And so I would say listen with an open mind.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">That's great. No, I really appreciate that. We're excited to share with you
              guys. Here's an invitation. We're going to dive into a bunch of different interviews that are
              very wide ranging in terms of topics, experience, and the personnel on it.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s">I know as we've done these interviews, not one of them is like
              the other. They're all full of little nuggets. Please feel free to reach out to us and engage in a
              conversation as you're starting to learn these things. We would love to hear from you.Thank you,
              Matt.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Matt</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Thanks Jared.</span></br>
            <span class="copy-s-bold">Jared Henriques</span>
            <span class="copy-s">Bye Our next episode, I'm going to be chatting with Salima Visram, the founder
              and CEO of Samara. Samara is a luxury fashion brand that specializes in minimal and simple products.
              While most of their focus has been on bags, they're looking to expand their product offering into
              clothing
              and accessories very soon. Their goal is to create better fashion, implement more efficient supply
              chains,
              and develop more sustainable materials. They are an ecofriendly business that is always looking for more
              ways to improve.</span></br>
